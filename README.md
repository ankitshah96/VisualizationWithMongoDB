Visualizing Geo Spatial Data with Mongo DB

# 1. Spirograph around Tommy Trojan Statue
  It uses data points generated by Spiro.py script to visualize spirograph plot of Geo Spatial locations around Tommy Trojan statue.

# 2. Bounding Box
  It filters locations based on bounding box and shows only location within it.
  
# 3. Triangular Bounding
  I have used National Park data from: https://www.nps.gov/lib/npmap.js/4.0.0/examples/data/national-parks.geojson and have done spatial querying on it to filter and show only those National parks that are within a Triangular Bounding area.
  
# 4. Geospatial Scatter Chart
  Scatter chart to visualize locations based on attributes like popularity and location type.
